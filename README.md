well hello there
since you are here, you might as well forgot about this add-on, so let's get started
all that you need to know is that this add-on will get the deck with the given name and reads it's fields,
merges them and sends them to Google TTS ,takes back the audio and adds it to another field
remember that these fields are set, according to "German Vocabulary" note type.

Good luck
